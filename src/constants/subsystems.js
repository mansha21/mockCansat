This six-pin module supports both SPI and I2C interfaces. It uses a BMP280 barometric pressure sensor. These sensors are pre-calibrated, unlike other sensors. Therefore, they start measuring temperature, pressure, and humidity instantly after powering them. You don’t need extra components for its calibration or operation."
