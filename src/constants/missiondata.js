            sounding rocket provided by the competition. This carrier has to perform multiple maneuvers:
            The carrier will be released at the altitude of 2000 meters from the ground of the
            launch site.
            The location of the launch site is 12°58'32.2"N 79°09'38.3"E.
            Once the carrier is released the carrier should perform a helical maneuver,
            the diameter of the helix should not exceed 1000 meters.
            The carrier is supposed to perform the helical maneuver for 500 meters from the
            release point.
            Once the carrier starts performing the helical maneuver, the carrier should
            transmit data to the ground station. Data should include mission time, altitude,
            orientation and GPS coordinates of the carrier.

        can record accurate values.
